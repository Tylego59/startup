# Date Idea Generator

[My Notes](notes.md)

An application that allows the user to generate date ideas.

### Elevator pitch

A date generator app. This app will allow you to input the mood: Is it a first date? Sports or movie? Video games or board games? Hike or side quest? Then from those answers the app will generate the perfect date idea. You can have people submit reviews for their generated date about how well it may or may not have gone. The UI will be simple, presenting one question at a time and having clickable options. The ability to return to a previous question will be provided. You can save generated date ideas for later reference.

### Design

In the crude drawings above, the general layout of the app is presented with a title above, interactable login, and interactable buttons for the prompts and saving the generated idea.

### Key features

- Interactable questions that allow for ultimate date idea generation
- Ability to save generated ideas
- Ability to review used ideas and see reviews from other users

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Three HTML pages. One for login, second for input and idea generation, and third for saved ideas and user ranking.
- **CSS** - Easy to navigate with buttons that push in on animation, and transition animations to give the app life.
- **React** - Provides login, option to generate idea or view saved ideas, generation leads to prompts for the idea, option to save idea, in saved ideas can review ideas, ability to see other users' reviews
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
Answering prompts for idea generation.
Retrieve other users' reviews on applied ideas.
Send out user's own reviews.
Register, login, and logout users. Ideas are saved to accounts.
- **DB/Login** - Store users, friends, saved ideas, and idea reviews.
- **WebSocket** - As users submit reviews, they are sent out.
